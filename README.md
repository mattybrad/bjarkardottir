An Arduino/Teensy guitar synth

## What Is It?
Eventually, this will be a guitar-like electronic instrument, which is played in the same way as a guitar but with a radically different sound. The fretboard is touch sensitive. The area which would normally be picked or strummed is instead a series of lasers (a mini laser harp). The sound is produced by a Teensy with an audio adaptor.
